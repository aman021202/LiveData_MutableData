About Live data & Mutable Live Data
Live data is the data holder class but the data can only be observed
And also this is the Lifecycle aware i.e. it will reach to the only components which are in their active state 
We have two kinds of Live Data i.e. 1. Mutable Live Data = Data that we can   change                              2. Live Data = we cannot change the Data of Live Data
